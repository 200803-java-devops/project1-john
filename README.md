# Project Proposal

John stibbards

For project 1, I will be building an automated build and deployment tool in java. This tool will be used to simplify the process of running the varying commands necessary to build, initialize and test a java program. The primary processes I will focus on for the tool to manage are maven, junit, git, and postgres via docker containers. As there are pre existing tools that already fulfill this goal in java development, the end result for this project will ideally mirror the baseline functionality of one of these tools, such as Jenkins.

## User Stories

As a developer, I want to be able to confirm my project builds successfully so that changes pushed to github can be proven functional.
As a developer, I want to be able to remotely run any unit tests for my program so that object functionalities can be confirmed after new code is added.
As a user, I would like to be able to run a program built with maven/docker without the need to fuss with command line arguments so that I can use the program easily.
